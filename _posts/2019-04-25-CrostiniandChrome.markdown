title: Crostini and Chrome
---

My initial plan was to pick up a cheap laptop and drop a linux distro on it. Not a bad idea and definitely in tune with with some of my more GNU inspired ethics.
I discovered several things along the way. 

1. Cheap laptop means old and preowned. Which comes with its own litany of drawbacks. 
My intent is to make the most of a 1.5 hour daily commute and that means flimsy and ancient batteries are out.

2. Dualbooting or complete OS replacment, while possible, drains time off of the core project. 
It's also a project I have done before, but finding the right hardware, distro and system is a pain when you just want to get to learning.

3. Chrome and Crostini are perfectly suited to the task at hand. 
Since the goal is to use use a light weight linux environment and only the most basic tools, the debian based crostini is literally perfect for this project. 
While my inner purist may cringe, this is the right choice.

So why the Samsung Chromebook 3? It fell perfectly in cost, hardware flexibility and manufactured date. It also allows the possibility of a later full conversion to Linux if that day ever manages to roll around.
