title: The Quest to Learn C
---

C is going to be my first language. 

To be fair, this isn't my first attempt at learning a language. In highschool I tried to pick up C++ and HTML, but both of those fell flat. I guess somewhere between listening to Good Charlotte and and playing Morrowind I got distracted. 

So why K&R? and why gcc as? Aren't there better, more efficient ways to learn the language?

Yes. Yes there are.

But none of them let me get to the roots of programming in quite quite the same way. I wanted an experience that woud teach me both the old and the new and incorporate my desire to go deeper with linux. I want to type the code myself, run it from a terminal and watch the software come to life. 

So who did this to me? Earl Evans did. With his podcast (https://retrobits.libsyn.com/) where I instantly remembered my dad trash picking an Apple II as a kid and the magic of that tube screen (lemonade stand was awesome). I remember DOS, and the way those illumiated words became magical, a little glipse into the technical underbelly of those video games I played as a kid. Or even the display computers at the microcenter I would go to to dig around in the discount bins. 

I want to not only learn the language, but I want to enjoy figuring out how to bridge the gap between the language and a current compiler. I am on a quest to learn C for what it is, an essential language that is close to the metal and close to the soul of historical and contemporary computing



All that said, here are the tools I am taking on this adventure:

The C Programming Language 2nd Edition

The GNU Compiler Collection

Text Editor (This is literally its name. It is the world simplist ide, it does a little color and highlights bracket pairs, thats it.)

Samsung Chromebook 3 with Crostini (Debian)
